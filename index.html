                <h6> <em>Hyderabadi Biryani </em> </h6>
                <em class= "text-secondary">If you were to rank the cuisine of Hyderabad by popularity, the biryani of Hyderabad will be at the top of the charts without the least confusion in the matter. Most people would be ready to consume it at any hour of the day and its rich aromatic flavour and taste never fail to bring anyone back for a second helping! It is usually made with mutton, but chicken biryani is also a hot favourite.

                  Hyderabad’s most popular Biryani outlet, Paradise, has special packaging available for people who carry huge quantities of it home, on a domestic flight. </em>

                <h6> <em>Mumbai Vada Pav </em> </h6>
                <em class= "text-secondary">At a speed that is rarely expected from a street-side fast-food vendor, he dropped a batch of perfectly shaped spherical ‘batata vada’ into the hot cooking oil which had been sizzling for quite some time. Vada are potato patties made out of mashed potatoes mixed with finely chopped onion, green chillies, coriander, and spices that are dipped in chickpea batter just before frying. After tossing and turning the Vada five-six times, they were ready. He picked up a square-shaped bread, called ‘Pav’ and sliced it open with a doctor-like precision and finesse. He slathered it with a green chutney (made out of chilli and coriander) and a garlic chutney and placed the Vada in between the two layers of Pav. He wrapped it in a square paper cutout made with an old newspaper and handed it over to me along with 2 fried green chillies in exchange for 20 bucks. The moment I bit into the “Vada Pav”, as it is popularly called in Mumbai, its taste etched a gastronomical memory in my mind that I will never forget. It was, in simple words, just delicious. </em>
